# Ignore executables in all directories
# This rule will ignore any file without an extension that has execute permissions
# Note: This rule is more specific to Unix-like systems
# If you have a known set of executables, list them explicitly
# For generic executables with no extensions, the pattern may vary

# Ignore all files with no extensions in all directories
# Use a more specific pattern if needed for executables
# Here, we're assuming executables are files without an extension
# Use the `!*/` rule to prevent directories from being ignored
